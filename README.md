## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

- I separated the design into sections first.
- I then thought about what I would use in CSS to style the cards i.e. Flexbox.
- I built the first card and styled it before building the next one.
- It was important for me to see the project work well, so I used the inspect option in the browser to debug my code throughout the entire process.
- I then finished with JavaScript and rectified a few spacing issues.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript Vanilla

### What I learned

- I regained my confidence in the basics of DOM manipulation and had a refresher on Array methods.

### Continued development

Concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with:

- Using grid: I'm more comfortable with Flexbox, so I opted to use it to structure my cards.
- Using forms: I attempted to use radio buttons but I got confused midway and decided to approach the selection of rating values using event handlers instead.

### Useful resources

- I was a little fuzzy with manipulating CSS in JavaScript, and W3schools came to the rescue. [Link to tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_css.asp)
